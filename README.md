### Ortholinear, columnar stagger keyboard switch plate and case
* Inspired by the Ergodox, Corne, Alice, and probably others

* Design goals:
    * Efficiency and minimalism of a 40% form factor
    * Ergo benefits of columnar stagger combined with a tilted ortholinear layout
    * Ease of use coming from ANSI style layouts
    * Simplicity of a non-split keyboard

* Compatible with Ergodox style keysets


### Assembly:
* Stacked acrylic layer case, metal switch plate (or could also be acrylic)
    * Plate and middle layer holes are compatible with standard M2 brass screws/standoffs
* The rear cutout is designed for a mini usb connection, like the one on the Teensy2.0.


### Note:
* Kerf of plate is set to 0.15mm (typical for laserboost/lasergist)
* Default firmware does not include any LED configuration.

### To-do:
* Add case CAD files
* Add firmware files
